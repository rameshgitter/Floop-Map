1.3 Motivation Behind the Work 
Despite advancements, existing systems often face limitations such as 
high computational costs, lack of real-time data integration, and 
limited accessibility for end-users.  
This work aims to address these challenges by developing an 
accessible, efficient, and user-friendly flood prediction system.  
The motivation stems from the need to: 
●​ Enhance prediction accuracy. 
●​ Make flood prediction tools accessible to a broader audience. 
●​ Provide a platform for visualizing flood risks effectively.
